The goal of this course is to help students improve their knowledge and skills in the field of
theory of computation. In particular, students will learn about various models of computation,
mathematically analyze their behavior, and explore the limits of computation. Students
will also become familiar with core concepts in complexity theory, including reducibility, time
complexity, and space complexity.

## Course Texts and Materials

There is no required text for this course. Lecture notes will be provided.

## Class Expectations

Attendance is expected, and it is the student's responsibility to keep up with course lessons and work.

## Grading

1. Homework (0%): Homework will not be apart of your grade for this course. However, problem sets will be released periodically, and from these problem sets the quiz and final exam questions will be chosen. You can have these assignments graded for you with feedback by submitting them to Gradescope. 

2. Lessons (10%): There will be multiple choice Gradescope assignments throughout the semester to assess your understanding of the material.

2. Quizzes (60%): There will be three in-person, handwritten quizzes throughout the semester.

3. Final Exam (30%): The final exam will be in-person and handwritten.

### Quiz Absence Policy

You may be absent for up to one quiz.

Being absent from a quiz results in the quiz’s credit being drawn down from your final exam score’s weight. As such, this is not a penalty; your mastery of this quiz’ material will be assessed on the cumulative final exam.

If, and only if, you take all quizzes and your final examination score exceeds your lowest quiz score, then we will retroactively grant you an absence for the lowest quiz score and your final exam score will be worth 50%.

#### *Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use Policy (**required** statement on **CAS** syllabi)*

All Carolina students are expected to follow these AI guidelines:  

1. AI should help you think, not think for you. You may be able to use these tools to brainstorm ideas, research topics, and analyze problems, but you must decide what’s appropriate and accurate.  
2. Engage responsibly with AI. You must evaluate AI-generated outputs for potential biases, limitations, inaccuracies, false output, and ethical implications. Do not put personal or confidential data into these tools.   
3. The use of AI must be open and documented. You should declare, explain, and cite any use of AI in the creation of your work using applicable standards (e.g., APA, MLA, course guidelines). Understand that you are ultimately 100% responsible for your final product.   
4. Follow specific AI guidelines in this syllabus. If you are unsure, check with me. Guidance offered in this syllabus would be referenced should an issue be referred to Student Conduct for alleged academic misconduct.
